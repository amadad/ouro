Digital Being Framework - Migration Guide

Project Overview:
-----------------
Migrate the existing Digital Being project to use the OpenAI Agents SDK, 
adopting a clean, agent-centric design inspired by the Pippin framework.

Core Principles:
----------------
1. Agent-Centric Design: Define each task as an autonomous agent/tool.
2. Composable Skills: Expose domain-specific logic (e.g., Twitter, Chat, Image) as callable tools.
3. Persistent Memory & State: Maintain context and history for improved decision-making.
4. Simplified API & Authentication: Centralize API key/secret management and Compose.io OAuth.
5. Robust Error Handling: Provide clear logging and graceful degradation.

Key Components to Migrate:
---------------------------
1. Activity Definition:
   - Convert @activity-decorated classes (tasks) into function tools or sub-agents.
   - Use a structured result (e.g., ActivityResult) to capture success, data, and errors.

2. Activity Loader & Selector:
   - Adapt dynamic loading to register agent tools.
   - Implement selection logic based on cooldown, energy, and personality factors.

3. Memory & State Management:
   - Keep a simple in-memory store for recent interactions (short-term) and archive older ones (long-term).
   - Update energy, mood, and other state values periodically.

4. API Key & Compose.io Integration:
   - Centralize API key storage and retrieval.
   - Manage OAuth flows for Compose.io as a dedicated module or tool.

5. Skills System:
   - Rework skills (Chat, Image, Web Scraping, Twitter, etc.) as function-based tools.
   - Each skill handles its own authentication and API communication.

6. Main Orchestrator:
   - Create a core Agent/Runner that uses the new OpenAI Agents SDK to call sub-agents (tools) as needed.
   - Orchestrate activity selection and execution in a simple loop.

7. User Interface / Server:
   - Optionally maintain a web or CLI interface for configuration, monitoring, and onboarding.

Implementation Phases:
------------------------
Phase 1: Foundation
  - Refactor core components (activity definition, memory, state, API management).
  - Build a basic agent structure with function tools.
  - Ensure key skills (e.g., ChatSkill) are callable.

Phase 2: Expansion
  - Enhance skills with full functionality and error handling.
  - Implement advanced memory (e.g., context retrieval or vector storage).
  - Refine activity selection (energy/cooldown constraints, personality weighting).

Phase 3: User Experience
  - Develop a simple dashboard or CLI for monitoring and configuration.
  - Support multi-agent handoffs and collaborative task delegation.

Coding Standards:
-----------------
- Structure: Each skill and activity in its own file.
- Naming: Use consistent naming (e.g., activity_[name].py, skill_[name].py).
- Documentation: Include clear docstrings and type hints.
- Error Handling: Use custom exceptions and detailed logging.

Getting Started:
----------------
1. Clone the repository.
2. Set up a Python virtual environment (Python 3.9+).
3. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Configure API keys in a .env file (copy .env.sample to .env).
5. Run the application: `python digital_being/app.py`

Key Challenges:
---------------
- Fix and simplify Compose.io integration and OAuth flow.
- Refactor code for better modularity and maintainability.
- Implement a robust agent structure with clear memory and state management.
- Develop dynamic skill registration and discovery.

# Example: Basic Agent Tool Skeleton (to be adapted using OpenAI Agents SDK)

async def example_agent_tool(input_data: dict) -> dict:
    """
    This function represents a simple agent tool.
    Replace this with your real task logic (e.g., generating a chat response).
    
    Args:
        input_data (dict): Input parameters for the task.
    
    Returns:
        dict: Structured result with keys 'success', 'data', and optionally 'error'.
    """
    try:
        # Initialize required skills (e.g., ChatSkill) and process input
        result = {
            "success": True,
            "data": {"message": f"Processed input: {input_data}"}
        }
    except Exception as e:
        result = {"success": False, "error": str(e)}
    return result
