# Predeployment Checking and Testing Instructions

1. **Install Pre-commit (One-time Setup)**
   ```bash
   pip install pre-commit
   pre-commit install
   ```

2. **Run Pre-commit Hooks (Fast Checks)**
   - Automatically runs on commit, or manually with:
   ```bash
   pre-commit run --all-files
   ```
   This checks:
   - Python syntax (check-ast)
   - YAML/JSON/TOML validation
   - Code formatting (ruff)
   - Type checking (mypy)
   - Security issues (detect-private-key)
   - Merge conflicts
   - Debug statements

3. **Run Tests Locally (Before Push)**
   ```bash
   # Build test image
   docker build -t my-digital-being-test .
   
   # Run tests with coverage
   docker run --rm my-digital-being-test pytest tests/ -v --cov=my_digital_being --cov-fail-under=70
   ```

4. **Push to Trigger Azure Deployment**
   ```bash
   git push
   ```
   This triggers:
   - Azure Container Registry build
   - Deployment to Azure Web App
   - Full test suite in production environment

5. **Monitor Deployment (Azure)**
   - Check Azure Portal for deployment status
   - Monitor logs for any issues
   - Verify the web app is running correctly

The key differences from your version:
1. Added the initial pre-commit setup step
2. Specified what exactly pre-commit checks
3. Added Azure deployment monitoring
4. Removed redundant manual checks (hadolint, pip-audit) as they're part of pre-commit
5. Emphasized Docker testing before pushing to Azure

Would you like me to:
1. Add more details about any specific step?
2. Add Azure-specific monitoring commands?
3. Create a shell script that automates these checks?
